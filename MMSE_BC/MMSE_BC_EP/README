Instead of normal soundwave(SW) signals, the input here are envelop power derived inversly from EP signals (only 8 channels).

The results demonstrate similar pattern just like the results from SW, 
but with a minor issue with systematic error(underestimated bias).
This results mainly from the hyper-parameter, i.e. gain function set experimentally for SW input. 
Therefore some adjustments on the choices of gain should be considered in the later process.
